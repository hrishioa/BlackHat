IOT Health monitoring system for Construction workers

The system, developed for the LinkIT ONE, makes use of IMU data along with environmental sensors (air quality, heat, etc.) to generate a worker profile. This worker profile is used to assess the quality of conditions and whether they are suitable for construction workers. A health indicator is generated that provides a concise indicator of these conditions. 

On the second backend, a worker performance index is generated based on activity levels of the worker. This enables contractors to assess their workforce, to ensure optimum distirbution of workforce duties. This would enable them to asses which segments of the worker population are idle, and which are overworked.

Put them together, and you have a complete solution that is both beneficial to the workers and their employers.
